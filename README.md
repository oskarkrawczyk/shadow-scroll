# ShadowScroll
ShadowScroll will add top and/or bottom shadows to your overflowed scroll area
in order to indicate that there's still something to scroll.

- If you're at the very top, there's a bottom shadow
- If you're in the middle, there is a top and a bottom shadow
- If you're at the very bottom, there's a top shadow
